# PY-CL-WritingFiles


## Overview

This project demonstrates file writing in Python using the Lab class. The `Lab` class provides a method `write_to_file()` for writing content to a file. The project ensures that the method returns True only if content is actually written to the file using the `file.write()` method.

## Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file serves as the main entry point for the project. It interacts with the Lab class to write content to a file.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementation of the Lab class, which provides the write_to_file method for writing content to a file.

## Project Structure

  - main/
    - app.py
    - lab.py
  - test/
    - lab_test.py

## Getting Started

- Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
- Run the `app.py` file to execute the example of writing content to a file.
- Explore the code in lab.py to understand the implementation of the Lab class and the `write_to_file` method.

## Conclusion

This project provides a demonstration of file writing in Python using the Lab class. By examining the examples and code provided, users can gain a better understanding of how to write content to a file and ensure the success of the operation.

Happy Coding!
